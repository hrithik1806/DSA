Some special functions that c++ gives you when you create a classs 
4 different functions that ae always present inside a class
1 Copy constructor ---makes a copy of the given object
                      exists by default
                      you may have your own copy constructor if deep copy is needed
                      
2 constructor  ---that is responsible for creating a cobject
                  gets called automatically and only once
                  same name as class name
3 Copy Assignment operator
      ---make the copy of the given object
      --copies when you do Assignment
      --car d=c/copy constructor
      --car d
      d=c;//copy assignment operator
      functionality copy constructor jaisi hi hoti hai bas tareeka likhne a change ho jata hai

      
4 Destructor


**if we have two more constructor in the class with same name but different functins then it is termed as constructor overloading
